# Weather-React

Areas for improvement with this website:

Fix the disconnect between my geolcation function and my api call

Fixing above would then allow me to successfully filter and map
through the list array -- ultimately allowing me to make a forecastCard component, rather
than coding each

Add 5-day forecast that includes each 3-hour update
Refactor so that my App.js is only rendering my components
Enhance styling of the pages
Include a loading feature, in case of delays for content
Expand test coverage
