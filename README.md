# weather-react

Areas for improvement with this website:

    Fix the disconnect between my geolcation function and my api call


    Fixing above would then allow me to successfully filter and map
    through the list array -- ultimately allowing me to make a forecastCard component, rather
    than coding each

    Add 5-day forecast that includes each 3-hour update
    Refactor so that my App.js is only rendering my components
    Enhance styling of the pages
    Include a loading feature, in case of delays for content
    Expand test coverage
